## continue in do-while
Prior to version 0.5.0 of solidity, there was a bug with using the 
**do-while-statement**. Using the **continue-statement** in the **do-while-statement** causes the bug to skip the conditional judgment and go directly to the loop body for execution again.
Bug type: context-related bug
