# Improper use of require, assert, and revert
*Solidity* language provides several statements (*require*, *assert*, and *revert*) to handle errors. These statements are slightly different when used, so they need to be used correctly. For example, *require* should be used for input validation, *assert* should be used to validate invariants, and *revert* is used for termination and rollback transactions. In addition, the *require* does not consume any *gas*, but *assert* consumes all available *gas*.
