## Implicit visibility level
Prior to *Solidity* 0.5.0 version, you could not explicitly specify the visibility of state variables and functions, which would be given by default (after 0.5.0, functions must specify visibility). Not explicitly specifying visibility makes the code hard to understand, and state variables that do not explicitly specify visibility are set to **private**.
