## Delete dynamic array
When the size of a dynamic array is large, deleting the array results in a large consumption of **gas**. In extreme cases, this causes the transaction to be refused packaging by the blocks. In general, if you can do without deleting an array, keep it. If you must delete the arrays, try deleting them one by one.
