"Name":"Integer truncation error",
"Characteristic": [
	{"Characteristic1" : "Casts a long integer to a short integer"},
	{"Characteristic2" : "The short integer is not accurate enough to accurately save the value of the long integer, so there is a loss of precision after truncation."}
	],
"Consequence":"In general, this bug causes a loss of accuracy. When the result of the loss of accuracy is used to calculate the amount of ethers, it causes economic loss,"
}
